### Description
This repo is the open source for the RealOemPlus Chrome extension that can be found in the Google Chrome Web Store. This extension gives power to users of RealOEM so that popular parts sites like FCP Euro, ECS Tuning and Pelican Parts are easily integrated.

### Usage
The extension is very simple and just adds a "Lookup" button to each part in a table on RealOEM. Upon clicking this button, a new tab is opened with a search for the specific row's part number on FCP Euro, ECS Tuning and Pelican Parts
